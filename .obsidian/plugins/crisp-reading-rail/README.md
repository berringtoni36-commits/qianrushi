# Crisp Reading Rail

Crisp Reading Rail adds a compact reading-progress and heading-navigation rail to the right edge of each eligible Obsidian Markdown Reading view. Its proportional heading marks, orb-centered focus line, animated wave, and optional orbs sit alongside the visual language of Crisp File Explorer without occupying Obsidian's native right sidebar.

## v0.3.6 behavior

- Works in Markdown Reading view on desktop Obsidian.
- Shows borderless progress from `0.00` to `1.00`, completed-tick state, content-proportional H2-H4 marks, and a spring-following current-position orb.
- Uses only a short, fading line centered on the orb; there is no persistent full-height vertical rule.
- Bends nearby fine and heading marks leftward in a natural wave while scrolling. Reduced-motion mode snaps directly to the reading position.
- Reveals H2, H3, and H4 labels when the pointer comes within 96px, on hover, or on keyboard focus. Labels remain clickable for three seconds after leaving.
- Coalesces pointer proximity measurements to one layout read per animation frame.
- Wraps long labels to at most three lines and uses their measured heights to prevent collisions without changing document layout.
- Keeps repeated keyboard navigation cumulative, immediate, and silent instead of restarting smooth movement.
- Follows Crisp File Explorer orb changes without reacting to its own DOM mutations, including when the companion orb loads later.
- Clicking a label glides to its heading with the orb aligned to the same heading mark. Clicking the track jumps to the corresponding document position.
- Dragging the orb scrubs the document continuously and stays locked to the pointer even while Obsidian virtualizes a long note.
- Hides when the pane is narrower than 680 px or the note does not scroll.
- Gives every side-by-side Reading pane an independent rail.

## Orb style setting

Open **Settings → Crisp Reading Rail → Orb style** to choose Default, Random per day, 19 material/character styles, or **Follow Crisp File Explorer**. Follow mode observes only the companion orb's live `data-orb-style` value in the same Obsidian window; if it is unavailable, the rail uses Default.

All SVG and PNG resources used by Crisp Reading Rail are installed in this plugin's own `assets/` directory. It does not read Crisp File Explorer's files or private settings at runtime.

## Navigation sound setting

Open **Settings → Crisp Reading Rail → Navigation sound** to opt into very soft interaction feedback. Sound is off by default. When enabled, dragging across heading marks produces rate-limited quiet ticks, while track clicks, heading selections, and normal drag release use a subtle settle tone.

Normal wheel, touchpad, touch, keyboard, and programmatic scrolling remains silent. Sounds are synthesized locally with Web Audio; the plugin contains no audio files and makes no network requests.

## Keyboard interaction

Focus the rail's single reading-position slider, then use:

- Arrow keys to move by 1%.
- Page Up and Page Down to move by 10%.
- Home and End to move to the beginning or end.
- Tab to reach visible native heading buttons.

Keyboard handling is local to the focused rail. The plugin does not register default hotkeys, intercept Obsidian shortcuts globally, or play navigation sounds for slider key presses. Reduced-motion preferences replace smooth navigation with immediate movement.

## Local installation

For the prebuilt release ZIP:

1. Unzip the archive.
2. Copy its `crisp-reading-rail` folder into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory.
3. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins**, reload plugins, and enable **Crisp Reading Rail**.

The release archive intentionally omits `data.json`, so it installs with neutral defaults and contains no vault-specific settings.

For development from source:

1. Run `npm ci` and `npm run build`.
2. Run `npm run deploy -- "/path/to/your/vault"`.
3. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins**, reload plugins if needed, and enable **Crisp Reading Rail**.

The deployment command copies `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, and the complete `assets/` directory into `.obsidian/plugins/crisp-reading-rail`. Existing `data.json` settings are preserved.

## Privacy and safety

Crisp Reading Rail does not access the network, collect telemetry, edit notes, change files, or alter the workspace layout. It reads only the metadata and rendered headings for currently open Markdown Reading panes.

## Known exclusions

The plugin does not support Live Preview, Source mode, mobile layouts, native Outline replacement, embedded-note headings, or H1/H5/H6 navigation.

## Development

- `npm test` runs the Vitest suite.
- `npm run lint` checks source and tests.
- `npm run build` type-checks and creates the production `main.js` bundle.
- `npm run check` runs the complete automated gate.
